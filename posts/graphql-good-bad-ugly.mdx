We just used a `###` subheading in our blog post.

```jsx
// Button.js

import styles from "../styles/Button.module.css";

const Button = ({ text }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <button className={styles.btn}>{text}</button>
    </>
  );
};
export default Button;
```
</Pre>

Always make those above you feel comfortably superior.
In your desire to please and impress them, do not go too
far in displaying your talents or you might accomplish
the opposite-inspire fear and insecurity. Make your
masters appear more brilliant than they are and you will
attain the heights of power.
